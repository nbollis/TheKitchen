Chicken Fajita Pasta
Description:
 
Notes:
Serves 4
 
Ingredients:
3 tablespoons oil
3 blank chicken breasts, sliced
2 blank red bell pepper, sliced
2 blank green bell pepper, sliced
1 blank yellow bell pepper, sliced
1 blank onion, sliced
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon pepper
1 tablespoon chili powder
1 tablespoon cumin
1 tablespoon garlic powder
5 cups milk
4 cups penne pasta
1 cup pepper jack cheese, shredded
 
Procedure: 
Heat oil in a large pot over high heat
Add chicken and cook until no pink is visible, about 5-6 minutes, then take the chicken out.
Add the bell peppers and onion, cooking until the onion is translucent, about 6 minutes.
Add the chicken back to the pot with salt, pepper, chili powder, cumin, and garlic powder, stirring until evenly coated, about 30 seconds.
Add the milk and the penne, stirring constantly to prevent any pasta from sticking.
Cook for about 20 minutes until pasta is cooked and the milk has reduced to a thick sauce that coats the pasta.
Add the cheese and mix until melted.
 
Cooked:
4/24/22: Turned out pretty good, substituted milk for almond milk and replacing 1/2 cup with heavy cream. Reducing the milk into the sauce took a while, which made me nervous, but the pasta did not end up overcooked.
