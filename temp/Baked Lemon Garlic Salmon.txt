Baked Lemon Garlic Salmon
Description:

Notes:
Serves 6

Ingredients:
2 pounds salmon
Blank blank extra virgin olive oil
1/2 whole lemon, sliced into rounds
Blank blank parsley, for garnish
1 large lemon, zested
2 blank lemons, juiced
3 tbls extra virgin olive oil
5 cloves garlic, chopped
2 tsp dry oregano
1 tsp sweet paprika
0.5 tsp black pepper

Procedure: 
Heat oven to 375 degrees F.
 Make the lemon-garlic sauce. In a small bowl or measuring cup, mix together the lemon juice, lemon zest, extra virgin olive oil, garlic, oregano, paprika and black pepper. Give the sauce a good whisk.
Prepare a sheet pan lined with a large piece of foil (should be large enough to fold over salmon). Brush top of the foil with extra virgin olive oil.
Now, pat salmon dry and season well on both sides with kosher salt. Place it on the foiled sheet pan. Top with lemon garlic sauce (make sure to spread the sauce evenly.)
Fold foil over the salmon (seam-side up). Bake for 15 to 20 minutes until salmon is almost completely cooked through at the thickest part (cooking time will vary based on the thickness of your fish. If your salmon is thinner, check several minutes early to ensure your salmon does not overcook. If your piece is very thick, 1 ½ or more inches, it may take a bit longer.)
Carefully remove from oven and open foil to uncover the top of the salmon.  Place under the broiler briefly, about 3 minutes or so. Watch closely as it broils to make sure it doesn’t overcook and the garlic does not burn.)
