Ingredients:
2 tablespoons vegetable oil 
1 blank small cinnamon stick 
10 blank black peppercorns 
5 blank dried red Kashmiri chillies, broken in half and seeds shaken out 
1 tablespoon coriander seeds 
1 teaspoon fennel seeds

7 cloves garlic, chopped

3 blank tomatoes, finely chopped

blank FewShavings nutmeg, to serve
 
Procedure: 
Heat half the oil in a frying pan over a high heat and add all the ingredients from the cinnamon to the poppy seeds. As soon as they start to sizzle, tip in the onions and fry for 7-8 minutes until very soft and golden, then add the ginger and garlic and fry for a minute or so. 
Stir in the coconut and fry until toasted and brown, stirring continuously to prevent it from scorching. Tip this mixture into a blender and add enough water to just cover it. Blitz to a fine puree and set aside.
Heat the remaining oil in the same frying pan (after giving it a wipe) over a high heat, add the chicken pieces and fry until sealed and light brown. Sprinkle in salt to season and the turmeric and cook for a minute or so, then pour in the purée from the blender and rinse the blender out with a little water. Pour this in as well. Add the tomatoes, bring to the boil then reduce the heat and simmer for 15-20 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through. Season to taste and serve hot with a few shavings of nutmeg.
